## Synopsis

These programs are some codes I have worked so far in the university

University of California - Berkeley
Florida Institute of Technology
Federal University of SÃ£o Carlos.

## Motivation

Most of them are assignments, but some I just did by curiosity and to learn how to implement some famous algorithmns.
It is important to note that most of them are hard-coded, I did it intentionally, because I was focused in the Algorithm implementation, not in the user-interface.
