## Synopsis

Write a program that creates two children, and connects the standard output of one to the
standard input of the other, using the pipe() system call.

In C it is possible to execute two process concurrently using the pipe idea, with the
function pipe(). When a pipe is created, it is defining a new descriptor, and its input and output
part can be used at the same time by two processes.
